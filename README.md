# Introduction

The Contact List Manager is a simple Java console-based application that allows users to manage their personal or professional contact information effectively. It provides a straightforward way to store, search, view, and delete contact details, ensuring easy accessibility and better organization of important contacts.

# Features

1. Add Contact: Users can add a new contact by providing the name and a valid phone 	number (exactly 	11 digits). The app will check if the phone number is valid before 	adding it.
2. View Contacts: This option shows you all the saved contacts, including their names and phone 	numbers. If there are no contacts, the app will let you know.
3. Search Contact: Type a name to find a contact. The app will search for it, no matter how the name is 	capitalized, and show you the matching contact if it exists.
4. Delete Contact: You can remove a contact by entering their name. If the contact list is empty or the 	name doesn't match any saved contact, the app will inform you.
5. Exit Application: Use this to close the app safely when you're done.
